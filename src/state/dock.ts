// Dock control (step 1.10) — a module-level handle on the app's single dockview

// prop-drilling the api out of `Workspace`. There is exactly one `DockviewReact`
// for the whole app (the per-project tree is *swapped* into it, decision 13 / §5),
// so one ref suffices. `Workspace` sets it on ready and clears it on unmount.
//
// "Focusing a panel" means more than activating its dockview group: for a console
// we also hand DOM focus to its pooled xterm terminal, so the keyboard lands in
// the live `claude` TUI rather than nowhere.

 * layout). That swap's reconcile pass re-asserts the target project's last-active
 * shell/editor/diff — their `activeId` is global and now points at a freshly
 * restored panel — and would otherwise steal the active panel + DOM focus from the
 * console you actually jumped to (the reconcilers run consoles first, so a later
 * editor/diff pass wins). A plain `routePanelFocus` from the caller also fires too
 * early: the target panel doesn't exist until the swap's reconcile adds it.
 *
 * So we poll across frames until the panel appears. The swap's reconcilers run in
 * one *synchronous* block once the layout load resolves, so the first frame that
 * observes the panel is guaranteed to be after every reconciler — our `setActive`
 * lands last and wins. Bounded so a panel that never arrives can't spin forever.
 * Same-project / already-open consoles satisfy the check on the first tick.

 *     `focusTerminal(panel.id)` focuses the live xterm. (A `params.instanceId`
 *     lookup misses shells, whose param is `shellId` — that was the original focus bug.)
 *   • editor — owns no pooled terminal; we focus its CodeMirror content directly
 *     (tagged with `data-wb-panel={editorId}` in the Editor panel).
 *
 * Each step is a no-op for the other panel types, so the right one wins.
 *
 * **Deferred a frame on purpose.** dockview's *programmatic* activation
 * (`api.setActive()`) intentionally does **not** move DOM focus — it only refreshes
 * its internal focus state — so without this the keyboard stays wherever it was
 * (the rail row, the previous console) or lands on nothing, and typing vanishes.
 * And activation also triggers a React re-render (`focusConsole` → reconcile);
 * focusing synchronously would be stomped by that commit. Running on the next frame
 * makes our focus the final word. Exported so the one activation chokepoint
 * (`Workspace.onDidActivePanelChange`) can route focus for *every* path — rail
 * selection, tab click, Ctrl+Tab — through the same place.
